# Tic-Tac-Toe (built with AngularJS and Firebase)


## TL;DR -- Go to [Hosted Demo](http://tictactoe-angularjs-firebase.herokuapp.com)


## What is this?

I wanted to learn [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). So I built this fairly simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to teach myself. I'm sure that the code related to both AngularJS and Firebase leaves much to be desired. Also, I didn't spend a lot of time styling things. Actually, once I got things mostly working, I pretty much abandoned development on the project altogether (after all, I only did it as a learning experience).

Still, perhaps you'll find it useful for your own purposes. If so, have at it!


## Notes

For the code to work, you'll need [my fork of angularFire](https://github.com/binaryfeed/angularFire), since (as of this writing) the upstream author hasn't yet merged my pull request.
